# Algorithm-Free-Man
### so this is a description written in 21/3/2023

I wanna record my experience of algorithm here. And maybe Leetcode, nowcoder and virtual-Juage will be the first starring role.

Lanqiao and CSP's practical topics will serve as the successor maybe I gauss.

Jesus! Pass the interviews and CSP-300!

Come on! I'll be the algorithmic free man starting today!

I'm hesitating about which language to use to train. C++ or Java ?

OK~ C++ finally~ So fuck and fighting!
