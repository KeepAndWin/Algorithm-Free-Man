# Algorithm-Free-Man

### so this is a description written in 21/3/2023

I wanna record my experience of algorithm here. And maybe Leetcode, nowcoder and virtual-Juage will be the first starring role.

Lanqiao and CSP's practical topics will serve as the successor maybe I gauss.

Jesus! Pass the interviews and CSP-300!

Come on! I'll be the algorithmic free man starting today!

I'm hesitating about which language to use to train. C++ or Java ?

OK~ C++ finally~ 


### Time is passing so fast / This is 15 April 2024

I have recieved Master Offer from The National University of Singapore!

So I'm in the final moments of my university years.

Only focusing on graduation project seems to be bored, so I will continue to my algorithm trip!

I'm Zeron! Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish!
